This release marks a few things, including the partial return of MCPatcher support. It also marks the moment that I finally got sick of wonk-ass "1.0pre" releases and decided to retroactively switch to the more standard `X.Y.Z` style.

Versions 0.13 and 0.14 were eaten by a grue.

* added log-end textures for all log types
* added pretty gravel
* added random "glitch" textures for bedrock if MCPatcher is installed
* added creepy, gritty as heck ender chest
* the return of quartz pillar and bookshelf connected textures
* reinstated birch leaves texture as a simple copy of the oak texture
* brightened obsidian and obsidian-based textures slightly
* enchanting table now has a red cloth, like the default
* added a hastily put together custom title screen panorama that will be changed later

I've been pretty indecisive about a number of things in this release, so I may have forgotten to list some of the things that have changed. I don't think I like MCPatcher very much.

Bringing the pack up to spec for Minecraft 1.6.

* brushed off the inch of dust that had settled on the project
* updated to new Resource Pack format
  * CTM support is gone until that crap's up to date
  * **breaks compatibility with Minecraft 1.5 and older**
* tweaked grass block colors
* added textures for mycelium
* added foliage colors (currently the same as grass, mostly)
* replaced cheesy wigglewater with a procedural texture
  * made the water a little more clear
  * flowing water still needs an update, oops
* forgot something important (most likely)

As per the new Resource Pack spec, this thing goes in the `resourcepacks` folder, *not* `texturepacks`.

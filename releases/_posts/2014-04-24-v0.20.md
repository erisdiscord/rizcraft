First update of the new year! Nine months (a coincidence--I wasn't pregnant) and five internal releases later and not much to show for it. But there's some nice stuff here anyways.

* fixes for Minecraft 1.7 compatibility??? That's all my notes say and I forget what actually changed.
* added podzol textures
* added acacia textures
* added dark oak textures
* added record icons
* added taller tall grass texture with lil brown seed pods
* added danny lion texture
* added tripwire texture
* added item icons for cauldron and wooden door (spoilers: they're just the front block textures)
* tweaked wood colors to make them richer and more contrasty

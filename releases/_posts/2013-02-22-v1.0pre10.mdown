Great new textures, including the torch I've been putting off forever.

* Added obsidian textures to go with your fancy Nether portals.
* Added enchanting table with a fancy as heck book.
* Added bookshelves. I have several variants ready for CTM support, but that's waiting for an official 1.5 release.
* Added cloth textures. Sorry, they're all the same except for the color.
* Added ice in the laziest way possible. It's just inverted still water.
* Added quartz block and pillar. No chiseled texture yet!
* Added emerald block!
* Added that friggin' torch finally.

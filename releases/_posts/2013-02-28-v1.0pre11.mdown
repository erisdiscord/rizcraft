Beginnings of MCPatcher (mostly CTM and custom colors) support, GUI textures and more.

* MCPatcher features
  * bookshelf alternates
  * top and bottom greebles for quartz pillars
  * unique wood fence texture
  * grass, redstone, water color maps
* generic GUI textures (but not containers or inventories)
* newly-required animation definitions for all animated textures
* removed custom fonts until I can figure out how character widths are determined in vanilla

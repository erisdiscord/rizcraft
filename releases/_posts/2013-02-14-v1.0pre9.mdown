Textures for all things fire and water. Not a very big update, but as of yet this is the update that has taken the most effort by far.

* Added weird, wiggly, hand-drawn textures for still and flowing water; may replace them later.
* Added procedurally generated, hand-tweaked textures for fire, lava and nether portal blocks.

New tall grass texture plus some minor touch-ups and fixes.

* Added textures for vertical dispensers and droppers.
* Fixed End stone not actually showing the custom texture; learned that texture names are case sensitive.
* Added pre-colored grass to sidegrass for unfancy people
* Tweaked the contrast of grass.
* Lightened outlines on diamond and emerald ore so they don't look as pasted-on.
* Added shading to the spider web texture so it doesn't just suck a whole bunch.
* Changed bedrock to a darker version of the normal stone texture, for now.
